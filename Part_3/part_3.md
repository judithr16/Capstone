## Implement Grafana Dashboard
* Plan A: Amazon Managed Grafana
* Plan B: Amazon Sellers API (most likely)
* Plan C: export and import Data manually. In this case the code has to be written in such a way, that it works with freshly exported data sets (no manipulating the dataset in Excel or similar beforehand)

## MVP
* in Grafana
* Sales Graph of products in quantities (not revenue)
* 1 line per product, all in one graph [like this](https://www.slideteam.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1280x720/p/r/products_annual_sales_comparison_graph_slide01.jpg)
