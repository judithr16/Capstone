## seasonal decomposition and forecasting
Seasonal decompositition 
* splits quantities into trend, seasonal factor and residual
* multiplicative approach
* +1 added to quantities per chosen frequency, as the model does not work with 0

Forecasting
* Theta model
* deseasonalises, forecasts, then reseasonalises the data
* multiplicative approach

## MVP
* Code naive seasonal forecast (1 per product)
* find products with high seasonal impact 
* show forecast
