## Use naive seasonal forecasting for predicting trends
This is something I have done previously, just in R instead of python. Since I have the code and step by step process, I should be able to implement this in 1-2 days. This is also not reliant on any previous data cleaning and I just need historical data, not necessarily live data, so it is independent from the other project parts.
* explanation: https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-forecasting-techniques-ef4295248e46
* might only be relevant for certain products
* possible implementation in Grafana?
* find cases in which this does not apply (eg. sales dependent just on weather and not on season or other external factors). Make suggestions for future analysis to fill the gaps

## MVP
* Code naive seasonal forecast (1 per product)
* find products with high seasonal impact 
* show forecast
